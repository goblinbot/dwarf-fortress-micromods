[h1]Obsidian Daggers[/h1]
Allows Large Knife/Daggers to be made from obsidian by stonecrafting - IF your civilization has access to Large Daggers. Made for fun tribal cavern themed forts, blood cults, and more!

[b]This mod does not by itself add Daggers to Dwarves.[/b]
My other [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922428425]"enable daggers" micromod[/url] or other Exotic Weapon mods can be used to unlock this.

This only adds the [CAN_STONE] tag to the weapon type itself, and should be compatible with playable race mods and custom sharpenable rock types.


Known issue: Sometimes weapons made from "odd" materials do not seem to have graphics when wielded - such as artifact axes made of bone. This can happen to the daggers as well, and I'm seeing If i can fix this (since Obsidian swords do have graphics)

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
