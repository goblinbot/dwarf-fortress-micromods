[h1]That's not a knife - this, is a <<+Knife+>>[/h1]

Cultists, bandits and rogues? Oh my! Unlocks the (foreign/exotic) weapon group Large Daggers to Dwarves, allowing you to Large Knifes / Daggers for Dwarves. 
Allowing for example:
[list]
  [*] Embarking with Dwarves with Knife User skills
  [*] Forging your own Steel Large Daggers
  [*] Spicing/theming up the cult-like military of your Necromancer filled mountainhome
  [*] Get knife wielding monster hunters from your dwarven neighbours?
[/list]
Balance wise, keep in mind that the internet seems mixed about the performance of Large Daggers - but generally people consider them exceptionally armour-piercing. Masterwork Steel Dagger wielding Ninja Dwarves might overperform a bit here - or just be an alternative to Spears.

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
