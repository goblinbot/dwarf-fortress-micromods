Sets High Boots to 'Forced', making them always available/craftable for Dwarves.

During world generation several types of armour/clothing can be "known" or not by civilizations, scaling on rarity. Oddly enough, I usually see this happen with "just" High Boots not existing, which can feel a bit Meh compared to being limited to just Low Boots.


The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
