# Dwarf Fortress MicroMods
My collection of (micro)mods made for Dwarf Fortress using the game's RAW txt files and graphics.

While built for the Steam Release of DF, most of these should be usable with older versions of DF. Things like "dwarves can enrage" are tiny tweaks I did more than 10 years ago.

## Steam Workshop
All items can be found on my [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/hellgoo/myworkshopfiles/?appid=975370).

## What?
Steam Workshop has a bunch of fun/good mods for Dwarf Fortress. But when I started making these tiny tweaks it would often occur that a mod would have 1-2 really fun features i'd like to use, but then have 15 other features in the same pack - such as a bug fix for two-handed weapons also just casually making them craftable instead of rare trade imports, etc.

The goal for these mods - small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
