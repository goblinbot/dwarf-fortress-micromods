Grants fighting Dwarves the ability to become [b]Enraged at all enemies![/b] Gaining the natural anger issues of the humble Wolverines and Honey Badgers.

Specifically:

Add [PRONE_TO_RAGE:10] to Dwarves (creatures_standard), which is the tag that causes animals like Honey Badgers to have a chance to become 'Enraged at all enemies!' in combat.
 
When Dwarves trigger ENRAGE, this can make them less fearless when in combat - both in the best and worst ways.

I don't know all the possible side-effects, but scenarios I've encountered in the past:
[list]
  [*]Miners actually bravely defending themselves from Troglodytes!
  [*]A Dwarven child trying to punch a Grizzly Bear.
  [*]Hunters becoming VERY invested in making sure their prey goes down.
  [*]Military Dwarves chasing the other Goblins that weren't included in their earlier kill orders.
  [*]Unarmed herbalists refusing to run from undead elves out of pure anger.
[/list]
I have yet to encounter a Tavern Brawl - and boy am I excited to see the possible result.

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
