Adds the ability create spears from obsidian at the crafting workshop, via the same (stone)crafting menu used for vanilla obsidian short swords. 

Requires one wooden log and one obsidian.

Known issue: Even though the items have icons, currently "odd material weapons" don't always seem to become graphically visible when equipped making it look like your soldiers are bare-handed - I've seen the same happen with Artifact battleaxes and whips at some points. The obsidian spear sometimes does this as well - but seeing as vanilla does render the shortswords, I'm checking the graphic files to see if I can get this one working.

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
