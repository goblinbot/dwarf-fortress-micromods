[h1]Sunflowers[/h1]
Adds the Common Sunflower to the surface world, a multi-purpose flower with edible seeds and useful oil.

Functionally, they work similar to Quarry Bushes, but on the surface. Picked Sunflowers can be processed (to bags) in the farmer's workshop for features such as:
[list]
  [*] Edible seeds (raw & cooked)
  [*] Edible leaves (cooked - quite bitter and herbal, apparently!)
  [*] Seeds pressed into Sunflower Oil
  [*] Sunflower Oil Soap - which I only learned today is actually a thing that exists.
[/list]
Sunflowers should spawn in all Temperate biomes, Tropical Grassland, Tropical Savannah and Tropical Shrublands. Usually in the more dry sections.

If seeds are obtained (usually via processing the flower in the Farmer's Workshop) they can be surface farmed every season.

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
