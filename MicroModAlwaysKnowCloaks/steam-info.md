Sets Cloaks to 'Forced', making them always available/craftable for Dwarves.

During world generation several types of armour/clothing can be "known" or not by civilizations, scaling on rarity. Technically your civilization could happen to know the science behind making Togas! But usually not - since they're "uncommon".

Cloaks being 'common' and sharing layer/location/coverage tags with other items - such as robes - gives it a decent % chance of not being known by your civilizations. This tweak sets Cloaks to [FORCED] for Dwarves, making them available 100% of the time.


The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
