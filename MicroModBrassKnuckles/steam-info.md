[h1]Knuckledusters![/h1]
Adds Metal knuckles - a new blunt weapon type, using the Striker skill to Punch, Jab or Uppercut your foes.

[h2]Specifics:[/h2]
[list]
 [*] Made at the Metalsmith - weapons menu.
 [*] Unique 'Forge brass knuckle' reaction added to Metalsmith.
 [*] Accessible to Dwarves, Humans and Goblins.
[/list]

[b]Stats/Balance:[/b]

The knuckles stats-wise are made to sit somewhere between Maces and Warhammers, while also having a fast 'Jab' attack which acts a bit more like a whip lash - though not the tiny 1:10 impact size.

They shouldn't overshadow the other weapons, but please let me know if it's the case - as my testing has been a bit limited so far.

[b]Known issues:[/b]
[list]
 [*] In the Embark screen, the skill Striker will show up twice - though they're in sync and still just one skill. In my testing this hasn't had any side-effects after.
 [*] The knuckle graphic icon doesn't change colors according to materials (yet)
[/list]

The weapon graphic used is a modified version of the [b]knuckleduster[/b] from the game [b]Pixel Dungeon[/b]

The goal for MicroMods such as this is to add standalone small changes that can easily be toggled on and off, instead of including them in a pack of multiple "All or nothing" features.
